\section{Discussions}

M1. Scalability: The MF should be scalable i.e. it can cope with a large number of monitoring data collectors. This requirement is very important in Cloud Computing scenarios due to a large number of parameters to be monitored for potentially large amount of services and elements of Cloud tiers that may grow elastically. 

M2. Heterogeneous data: The MF should consider a heterogeneous group of metrics. The MF must al- low the collection of service level runtime monitoring data, virtual IT-infrastructure monitoring data (e.g., VM level runtime monitoring), and fine-grained physical IT-infrastructure monitoring data (e.g., network links, computing and storage resources). 

M3. Polling Interval: The data collection mechanism must allow the dynamic customization of the polling interval. Dynamic nature of virtual platforms demands gathering of data in a sufficiently frequent manner, meaning that nodes should be monitored continuously. Naturally, smaller polling intervals introduce significant processing overhead inside nodes themselves. However, long polling intervals do not provide a clear picture of the monitored components. Therefore, an optimal trade-off between polling inter- val and processing overhead is required. 

M4. Relationship: In the above mentioned scenario, clusters of VMs and Physical Machines (PM) serve many kinds of applications, so there is a hierarchical relationship between applications, VMs and PMs.
There is also a possibility of migration of VMs and applications from one node to another, so relation- ships can be changed dynamically. Themetricâ€™s value must be tagged to show that they belong to a particular instance (e.g., application), and what is their relation to other instances (e.g., VM and PM). 

M5. Data Repository: The MF requires a data repository where raw monitoring data needs to be stored after collection. The original data set must be stored without down-sampling for auditing purposes. The stored, raw monitoring data can be retrieved by consumers to perform QoS fault diagnosis, SLA validation, plot rendering, and as an input for fine grained resource management. The database must be distributed in order to avoid single point of failure. Moreover, it must be scalable, and allow to store thousands of metrics and potentially billions of data points. 

M6. Non-Intrusive: The MF must be able to retrieve data non-intrusively from a variety of sources (for VM via libvirt API, for a host via cgroups, for the network via SNMP, for Java applications via JMX, etc.). Collection mechanism should easily be extensible by adding more plugins. 

M7. Interface: The MF should provide a REST interface that allows access to the current monitoring data in a uniform and easy way, by abstracting the complexity of underlying monitoring systems. A standard unified interface for common management and monitoring tasks can make different virtualization technologies and Cloud providers interoperable. A REST interface is a good choice due to ease of implementation, low overhead and good scalability due to its session-less architecture.
