abstract = {As online services become more and more popular, incident management has become a critical task that aims to minimize the service downtime and to ensure high quality of the provided services. In practice, incident management is conducted through analyzing a huge amount of monitoring data collected at runtime of a service. Such data-driven incident management faces several significant challenges such as the large data scale, complex problem space, and incomplete knowledge. To address these challenges, we carried out two-year software-analytics research where we designed a set of novel data-driven techniques and developed an industrial system called the Service Analysis Studio (SAS) targeting real scenarios in a large-scale online service of Microsoft. SAS has been deployed to worldwide product datacenters and widely used by on-call engineers for incident management. This paper shares our experience about using software analytics to solve engineers' pain points in incident management, the developed data-analysis techniques, and the lessons learned from the process of research development and technology transfer. {\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

abstract = {Graph-based transductive learning (GTL) is a powerful machine learning technique that is used when sufficient training data is not available. In particular, conventional GTL approaches first construct a fixed inter-subject relation graph that is based on similarities in voxel intensity values in the feature domain, which can then be used to propagate the known phenotype data (i.e., clinical scores and labels) from the training data to the testing data in the label domain. However, this type of graph is exclusively learned in the feature domain, and primarily due to outliers in the observed features, may not be optimal for label propagation in the label domain. To address this limitation, a progressive GTL (pGTL) method is proposed that gradually finds an intrinsic data representation that more accurately aligns imaging features with the phenotype data. In general, optimal feature-to-phenotype alignment is achieved using an iterative approach that: (1) refines inter-subject relationships observed in the feature domain by using the learned intrinsic data representation in the label domain, (2) updates the intrinsic data representation from the refined inter-subject relationships, and (3) verifies the intrinsic data representation on the training data to guarantee an optimal classification when applied to testing data. Additionally, the iterative approach is extended to multi-modal imaging data to further improve pGTL classification accuracy. Using Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease study data, the classification accuracy of the proposed pGTL method is compared to several state-of-the-art classification methods, and the results show pGTL can more accurately identify subjects, even at different progression stages, in these two study data sets.},

abstract = {his paper examines the current state of learning analytics (LA), its stakeholders and the benefits and challenges these stakeholders face. LA is a field of research that involves the gathering, analyzing and reporting of data related to learners and their environments with the purpose of optimizing the learning experience. Stakeholders in LA are students, educators, researchers, institutions, and government agencies. The way in which analytics information flows from students to other stakeholders involves a hierarchy, where all stakeholders are able to provide input and offer recommendations to enrich the learning process for the student. Challenges faced by stakeholders include the movement of traditional analytics to learner-centered analytics, working with datasets across various settings, addressing issues with technology and resolving ethical concerns. Despite these challenges, research points to solutions that will allow LA to transform teaching and learning. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

abstract = {Most current online education scenarios use a Learning Management System (LMS) as the basecamp for the course activities. The LMS offers some centralized services and also integrates functionality from third party services (cloud services). This integration enriches the platform and increases the educational opportunities of the scenario. In such a distance scenario, with the students working in different physical spatial locations, they find difficult to determine if their activity level matches the expectation of the course. A4Learning performs a daily-updated analysis of learners' activities by establishing the similarity between two given students. That is, finds students that are doing similar things in the Learning Management System. Then, the system finds and represents how similar students have similar achievements in the course. A4Learning can be integrated within the LMS to provide the students with a visual representation their similarity with others as an awareness mechanism, so that the students can determine the achievements of similar students in previous courses and estimate their own performance.},

abstract = {In online learning environments, teachers and course designers often get little feedback about how students actually interact with and learn in online courses. Most of the learning systems used by educational institutions store comprehensive log data associated with students' behaviours and actions. However, these systems typically reveal or report on very general and limited information based on this data. In order to provide teachers and course designers with more detailed and meaningful information about students' behaviour and their use of learning resources within online courses, an analytics tool has been developed. The tool incorporates functionality to access and analyse data related to students' behaviours in learning systems. This tool can provide valuable information about students' learning processes allowing the identification of difficult or inappropriate learning material, and can therefore significantly contribute to the design of improved student support activities and resources. {\textcopyright} 2011 ACM.},

abstract = {Analytical solutions are considered as increasingly important for modern enterprises. Currently, systematical adoption of analytical solutions is limited to only a small set of large enterprises, as the deployment cost is high due to high performance hardware requirement and expensive analytics software. Moreover, such on-premises solutions are not suitable for the occasional analytics consumers. In order to accelerate the prevalence of analytical solutions, this paper explores the feasibility of leveraging SaaS (Software-as-a-Service) delivery model to provide analytics capabilities as services in a cost-effective way. The main contributions of our work include: (1) proposing a framework to enable enterprise tenants to consume analytics capabilities as services; (2) developing a method to enhance existing analytics platform to support multi-tenancy so that a single software instance can effectively support multiple concurrent tenants; (3) designing an SLA (Service Level Agreement) customization mechanism to satisfy the diverse analytics capability demands of tenants. A prototype system has been developed to evaluate the feasibility of our approach.},

abstract = {Cloud computing is transforming the software landscape. Software services are increasingly designed in modular and decoupled fashion that communicate over a network and are deployed on the Cloud. Cloud offers three service models namely Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), and Soft ware as- a-Service (SaaS). Although this allows better management of resources, the Quality of Service (QoS) in dynamically changing environments like Cloud must be legally stipulated as a Service Level Agreement (SLA). This introduces several challenges in the area of SLA enforcement. A key problem is detecting the root cause of performance problems which may lie in hosted service or deployment platforms (PaaS or IaaS), and adjusting resources accordingly. Monitoring and Analytic methods have emerged as promising and inevitable solutions in this context, but require precise real time monitoring data. Towards this goal, we assess practical aspects for effective monitoring of SLA-aware services hosted in Cloud. We present two real-world application scenarios for deriving requirements and present the prototype of our Monitoring and Analytics framework. We claim that this work provides necessary foundations for researching SLA-aware root cause analysis algorithms under realistic setup.},
